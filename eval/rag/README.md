# RAG fixtures

The JSONL files under `datasets/` are provider-free fixtures used by focused
AI and reranker contract tests. Production tracing and evaluation are owned by
self-hosted Langfuse; there is no Python evaluator runtime here.

Import the provisional scraped candidate set with:

```sh
pnpm ops:langfuse:dataset:import --input /secure/rag-scraped-v1-provisional.jsonl --dry-run
```

The importer requires exactly 220 `GENERATED_CANDIDATE` rows and preserves Reel
IDs, evidence IDs, modality, and provenance hashes without making production
RAG requests.
